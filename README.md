## Executing the program

## Code organization

## List of Commands

1. **exit**
   - When the shell receives this command, it should free all memory and close itself.

2. **cd [DIRECTORY]**
   - Change the user’s working directory to DIRECTORY. If no argument is given, set the user’s working directory to the root directory.

3. **ls [DIRECTORY]**
   - Output the names of all the files in the given directory in alphabetical order. If no argument is given, then take DIRECTORY to be the user’s working directory.

4. **cat FILENAME**
   - Print the contents of the file specified by FILENAME to the output.

5. **find**
   - Recursively list the files in the current working directory and in all subdirectories.

6. **touch FILENAME [FILENAME ...]**
   - Create empty regular files at the locations specified by the FILENAMEs.

7. **echo "STRING" > FILENAME**
   - Overwrite the contents of the file FILENAME with the string STRING.

8. **echo "STRING" >> FILENAME**
   - Append the string STRING to the contents of the file FILENAME.

9. **mkdir -p DIRECTORY [DIRECTORY ...]**
   - Create the directory, and also create any parent directories that do not exist yet.

10. **mv PATH_1 PATH_2**
    - Move the file or directory at PATH_1 to PATH_2.

11. **cp [-r] PATH_1 PATH_2**
    - Copy the file or directory at PATH_1 to PATH_2.

12. **rm [-r] PATH [PATH ...]**
    - Remove the file or directory at PATH.

13. **ln FILENAME_1 FILENAME_2**
    - Create a hard link to FILENAME_1 located at the path FILENAME_2.

## Input and Output

The input consists of an arbitrary number of lines, each line containing exactly one of the commands described above. The last command is always `exit`.

You should print to stdout the output generated by running the input commands. Initially, you start in a system that only contains an empty root directory (which is also your initial working directory).

### Example

Input:
```
ls
echo "CS is fun." >> cs-hymn.txt
ls
cat cs-hymn.txt
rm cs-hymn.txt
ls
exit
```

Output:
```
cs-hymn.txt
CS is fun.
```
